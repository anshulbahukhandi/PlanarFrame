# PlanarFrame
This program is used to analyze plane frames

-This project was completed by me as a part of coursework (CEE 532) at Arizona state university.
-All the library file belongs to my Prof Mr. S.D Rajan .
-Skeleton code was made by Mr. Rajan for the ease of checking and it was completed by me.
-Please seek Mr. Rajan's or my permission before copying/modifying/using any part of the program anywhere.

If you need help understanding the code or find any mistake please contact me at anshulbahukhandi@gmail.com
I'll be more than glad to help.

-In a nutshell this project reads the frame data from a text file . Solves the frame for the requirements of 
 user and generates the output in a text file.
